                    journey of a thousand miles by fretting about how long it will take or how hard it will be. We
                    make the journey by taking each day step by step and then repeating it again and again until we
                    reach our destination

                    speaking to people rather than walking by them like they're stones that don't matter. As long as
                    you're breathing, it's never too late to do some good deeds. Do it now, do it today and see the
                    difference.
